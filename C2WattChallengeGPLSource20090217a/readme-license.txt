Watt challenge may currently depend on DLL's provided by Concept2 to communicate with 
Concept2 performance monitors (PM3 or PM4).  These files are rppm3csafe.dll; rppm3ddi.dll; and rppm3usb.dll (and associated .ini files).  These DLL's are provided along with both the source code package as well as the object code installer.  Concept2 specifically allows and encourages you to redistribute these DLL's freely with any derivitave works of this program that you release under the terms of GPL, and you may pass on these rights to redistribute the DLL's.  At the time of this writing and Watt Challenge program release, the source code for these above mentioned DLL's is not currently available under GPL or any other license.  Concept2 is reviewing the legal issues related to a possible DLL's source code release, however this work is not done yet.  If you have an inquiry or comments related to this topic, please conctact Scott Hamilton at Concept2 (scotth@concept2.com).  It should be noted that the DLL's could be eliminated by using publicly available information, namely the PM3 and PM4 communication protocol as published by Concept2.    This is an interesting project that someone may wish to tackle.  More information on the communications prototcol as well as updated DLL's can be obtained from the following link: http://concept2.com/us/service/software/sdk/
